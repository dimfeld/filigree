# filigree

Filigree is a web app framework based around Rust's Axum library. Its main feature is a templating system that generates data models and other functionality from configuration files, to reduce the amount of boilerplate needed to build your app.

This project is currently in early development, with things basically working but many features remaining to make it
truly useful.
